a react front end only app based on typescript and parcel for the build

using parcel due to simple support for web workers

scripts:
npm run start 
npm run build 

typecheck:
run tsc in the root directory
: note this fails after adding web worker as needed to change moduleResolution to esnext to support import.meta.url
build and stuff seems to still work so it's under investigation

preview prod build:
run this in the dist directory after doing a build: python -m http.server
refer to this link for explanation: https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally


Cloudflare Pages:
this is deployed to cloudflare pages

url: https://cssworkshop.pages.dev/

run a git push to get it uploaed to github, to which cloudflare is connected

I guess it has auto deployment enabled
